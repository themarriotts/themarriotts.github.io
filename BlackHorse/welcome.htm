<P><IMG SRC="bh6.jpg" WIDTH=196 HEIGHT=194 ALIGN=left> I have created
these pages in my little corner of cyber space show, that in these
barren times of bland Nitro Keg beer and pre-packed, deep frozen ,
de-hydrated  Pub Meals, there is are a refreshing oasis, where you
can still get good beer and freshly prepared food.</P>

<P>I have been frequenting the Black Horse at Walcote  for the last
twenty years or more and other than that, I have no other connection
with them. All the views comments and material found on this site is 
mine alone. I receive no financial reward for hosting this site.</P>

<P>If you are looking of the 'Real McCoy' when it comes to oriental
food then look no further. The Landlady is Thai herself and cooks the
food in an authentic and traditional style. Her major claim to fame
is that she once cooked a meal for the Thai Royal Family. A good
selection of Thai dishes can be found on the <A HREF="Menu.htm"
TARGET="_self">bar menu</A> with there traditional Thai names.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The beer is very well kept and there is always a good choice of
brews. The regulars include Hoskins &amp; Oldfield  'HOB' as well as
Hook Norton 'Old Hooky'. The guests are to numerous to mention here,
however I will have a 'Guest Ale' page on the site in the near
future. Apart form the beer there is also draft cider as well as a
choice of bottled ciders. While I am on the contents of the bar it is
worth mentioning the comprehensive selection of country fruit
wines.<IMG SRC="bh2.jpg" WIDTH=275 HEIGHT=258 ALIGN=right></P>
